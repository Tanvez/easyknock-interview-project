## This is a project for EasyKnock internship
Note: 
- I use OpenStreetMap to load the location because the GoogleMaps API had a watermark over their maps.
- [rc-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc-slider) npm package to implement slider(WIP).
- [react-geocode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-geocode) to look up Longitude and Latitude.
- [react-number-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-number-format) in order to format form inputs.
